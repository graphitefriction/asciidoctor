= STEM Processing

AsciiDoc defines syntax elements for adding xref:asciidoc:stem:stem.adoc[science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) expressions] to an AsciiDoc document.
Much like AsciiDoc itself, STEM notation allows the graphical notation that scientists, mathematicians, and engineers use to describe equations, formulas, etc be expressed in a plain text format.
It's up to the converter to interpret and transform the source of these expressions into a displayable format.
That's where STEM processing comes in.

In this page, we'll look at how STEM expressions are handled when converting AsciiDoc and survey the integrations Asciidoctor offers to process them for various output formats.

== How it works

When a converter comes across a STEM node in an AsciiDoc document, it passes the source of the expression to a STEM processing library, such as MathJax, which either displays the rendered expression itself or turns it into an image the converter can link to or embed in the output file.

The STEM integrations are activated when the `stem` document attribute is set on the document and, when required, the relevant library is installed.

You can explore these integrations in depth on the xref:mathjax.adoc[], xref:mathematical.adoc[], and xref:asciimath-gem.adoc[] pages.

If you're planning to convert to DocBook to leverage the DocBook toolchain, be sure to consider xref:docbook.adoc[] when deciding which STEM notation to use in your AsciiDoc document.
