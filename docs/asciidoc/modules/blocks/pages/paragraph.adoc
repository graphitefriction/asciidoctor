= Paragraphs

The bulk of the content in a document is paragraph text.
This is why Asciidoctor doesn't require any special markup or attributes to specify paragraph content.
You can just start typing.

== Create a paragraph

Adjacent or consecutive lines of text form a paragraph element.
To start a new paragraph after another element, such as a section title or table, hit the kbd:[RETURN] key twice to insert a blank line, and then continue typing your content.
