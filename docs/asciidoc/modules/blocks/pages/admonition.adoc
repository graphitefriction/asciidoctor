= Admonitions

// tag::intro[]
There are certain statements you may want to draw attention to by taking them out of the content's flow and labeling them with a priority.
These are called admonitions.
It's rendered style is determined by the assigned label (i.e., value).
Asciidoctor provides five admonition style labels:

* `NOTE`
* `TIP`
* `IMPORTANT`
* `CAUTION`
* `WARNING`

.Caution vs. Warning
[#caution-vs-warning]

When choosing the admonition type, you may find yourself getting confused between "caution" and "warning" as these words are often used interchangeably.
Here's a simple rule to help you differentiate the two:

* Use *CAUTION* to advise the reader to _act_ carefully (i.e., exercise care).
* Use *WARNING* to inform the reader of danger, harm, or consequences that exist.

When you want to call attention to a single paragraph, start the first line of the paragraph with the label you want to use.
