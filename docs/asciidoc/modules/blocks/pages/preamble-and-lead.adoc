= Preamble and Lead Style

[#preamble]
== Preamble

Content between the end of the xref:document:header.adoc[document header] and the first section title in the document body is called the preamble.
A preamble is optional.

.Preamble
[source#ex-preamble]

include::example$preamble.adoc[]

When using the default Asciidoctor stylesheet, the <<lead-style,lead style>> is automatically applied to the first paragraph of the preamble.
The result of <<ex-preamble>> is displayed below.

[#lead-style]
== Lead style

Apply the `lead` style to any paragraph, and it will render using a larger font size.
The lead style is assigned to the xref:attributes:roles.adoc[role attribute].
You can set `role` using the classic or shorthand method.

When you convert a document to HTML using the default stylesheet, the first paragraph of the <<preamble,preamble>> is automatically styled as a lead paragraph.
To disable this behavior, assign any role to the first paragraph.

The presence of the custom role (`normal`) informs the CSS not to style it as a lead paragraph.
