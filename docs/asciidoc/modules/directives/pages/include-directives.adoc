= Include Directive

The include directive provides a way to import content from another file into the current document.
The include directive has the following syntax:

----
\include::path[<attrlist>]
----

Although the include directive looks like a block macro, it isn't one.
The include directive is processed without any awareness of the surrounding context.
Think of it more like a file expander.

This directive is useful if you want to:

* partition a large document into smaller files (for better organization and to make restructuring simpler),
* insert snippets of source code (so your examples are kept up-to-date with the latest source files),
* populate tables with output from other programs (e.g., CSV data),
* create document variants by combining the include directive with preprocessor conditionals (e.g., `ifdef`), and
* reuse fragments and boilerplate content multiple times within the same document.

You can use the include directive as many times as you want in the same document.

CAUTION: The include directive is _disabled_ when Asciidoctor is run in secure mode.
In this mode, the include directive is converted to a link in the output document.
To learn more about secure mode, refer to xref:asciidoctor::safe-modes.adoc[Manage Security with Safe Modes].

[#include-anatomy]
== Anatomy

The include directive has the following anatomy:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
\include::path[leveloffset=__offset__,lines=__ranges__,tag(s)=__name(s)__,indent=__depth__]
----

The leveloffset, lines, tag(s) and indent attributes are optional, making the simplest case look like:

[source]
----
\include::content.adoc[]
----

The sections that follows go into detail about when the include is processed, how the include file is resolved, and how each attribute is used.

[#include-processing]
== Processing

Although the include directive shares the same syntax as a block macro, it is not a block macro and not processed like one.
Instead, it's a _preprocessor_ directive, like `ifdef` and `ifeval`.
It's important that you understand the distinction between the two.

A preprocessor directive is processed when the lines are read and before the document structure is parsed.
Therefore, it's _not_ aware of the surrounding document structure.
A preprocessor directive merely adds lines to the reader or takes lines away.
The include directive always adds lines.

The best way to think of the include directive is to imagine that it is being replaced by the lines from the include file (i.e., the imported lines).
Only then does the parser read and interpret those lines.
That's also why it's important to surround the include directive by blank lines if it imports in a discrete structure.
You only want to place include files directly adjacent to one another if the imported content should be directly adjacent.

[#include-resolution]
== File resolution

The path used in an include directive may be either relative or absolute.

If the path relative, the processor resolves the path using the following rules:

* If the include directive is used in the main (top-level) document, relative paths are resolved relative to the base directory.
(The base directory defaults to the directory of the main document and can be overridden from the CLI or API).
* If the include directive is used in a file that has itself been included, the path is resolved relative to the including (i.e., current) file.

//TODO show examples to contrast a relative vs an absolute include

These defaults makes it easy to reason about how the path to the include file is resolved.

If the processor cannot locate the file (perhaps because you mistyped the path), you'll still be able to convert the document.
However, you will get the following warning message during conversion:

 asciidoctor: WARNING: master.adoc: line 3: include file not found: /.../content.adoc

The following message will also be inserted into the output:

 Unresolved directive in master.adoc - include::content.adoc[]

To fix the problem, edit the file path and run the converter again.

If you store your AsciiDoc files in nested folders at different levels, relative file paths can quickly become awkward and inflexible.
A common pattern to help here is to define the paths in attributes defined in the header, then prefix all include paths with a reference to one of these attributes:

[listing]
....
:includedir: _includes
:sourcedir: ../src/main/java

\include::{includedir}/fragment1.adoc[]

[source,java]
----
\include::{sourcedir}/org/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor.java[]
----
....

Keep in mind that no matter how Asciidoctor resolves the path to the file, access to that file is limited by the safe mode setting under which Asciidoctor is run.
If a path violates the security restrictions, it may be truncated.

[#include-nonasciidoc]
== AsciiDoc vs non-AsciiDoc files

The include directive performs a simple file merge, so it works with any text file.
// NOTE this point about normalization should probably be moved to an earlier section
The content of all included content is normalized.
This means that the encoding is forced to UTF-8 (or converted from UTF-16 to UTF-8 if the file contains a BOM) and trailing whitespace and endlines are removed from each line and replaced with a Unix line feed.
This normalization is important to how Asciidoctor works.

If the file is recognized as an AsciiDoc file (i.e., it has one of the following extensions: `.asciidoc`, `.adoc`, `.ad`, `.asc`, or `.txt`), Asciidoctor runs the preprocessor on the lines, looking for and interpreting the following directives:

* includes
* preprocessor conditionals (e.g., `ifdef`)
//* front matter (if enabled)

This allows includes to be nested, and provides lot of flexibility in constructing radically different documents with a single master document and a few command line attributes.

Including non-AsciiDoc files is normally done to merge output from other programs or populate table data:

[source]
----
.2016 Sales Results
,===
\include::sales/2016/results.csv[]
,===
----

In this case, the include directive does not do any processing of AsciiDoc directives.
The content is inserted as is (after being normalized).

////
CAUTION: You *can* put AsciiDoc content in a non-AsciiDoc file.
Its content will still be processed as AsciiDoc, but any include statements will be ignored, and therefore cause errors later in processing.
It is likely to cause confusion, so best avoided.
