= Assign Revision Attributes with Attribute Entries

The revision information attributes can be set and assigned values with attribute entries.

== When should I set revision attributes explicitly?

You should set the revision attributes explicitly when one of the following occurs:

* the document doesn't have an author line,
* the document doesn't have a revision number,
* you want the full value of the revision number--including any letter and symbol prefixes--to be displayed, or
* a revision attribute's value contains characters or elements that conflict with the revision line syntax.

== Set the revision attributes

The attributes `revdate`, `revnumber` and `revremark` are set and assigned values in <<ex-entries>>.
The order of the attribute entries doesn't affect their order in the byline of a rendered document.

[source#ex-entries]
----
= The Intrepid Chronicles
:revdate: April 4, 2022
:revnumber: LPR55 <1>
:revremark: The spring incarnation of {doctitle} <2>
:version-label!: <3>
----
<1> Any non-numeric characters that precede the version number aren't dropped when `revnumber` is set using an attribute entry.
<2> The value of `revremark` can contain attribute references.
<3> The `version-label` attribute is unset so that the word _Version_ isn't displayed in the byline.

The result of <<ex-entries>> is displayed below.

The word _Version_ is absent from the rendered document's byline because xref:version-label.adoc[the version-label attribute] was unset.
