= Document Title

== Title syntax

The document title is written using a single equal sign (`=`), followed by one space, then the text of the title.
The only content permitted above the document title are blank lines, comment lines and document-wide attribute entries.
Below is an example of a document title followed by a short paragraph.

.Document with a title
[source]
----
include::example$title.adoc[tag=base]
----

Notice the blank line between the document title and the first line of prose.
That blank line is what offsets the document header from the body.

When the `doctype` is `article` or `manpage`, the document can only have one level-0 section title (`=`).
The `book` document type permits multiple level-0 section titles.
When the `doctype` is `book`, the first level-0 section title, located in the header, is the document's title and subsequent level-0 section titles are xref:sections:parts-and-chapters.adoc[part titles].

[#doctitle-attr]
== doctitle attribute

A document's title is assigned to the built-in `doctitle` attribute.
//Its value is identical to the value returned by `Document#doctitle`.
The doctitle attribute can be referenced anywhere in a document and resolves to the document's title when displayed.

.Referencing the doctitle attribute

include::example$title.adoc[tag=doc]

The `doctitle` attribute can also be used to set the document title instead of using a level-0 section title.
However, the attribute must still be set in the document header.

== Title visibility

You can control whether or not the document title appears in the converted document using the `showtitle` attribute.

When converting a standalone document, the document title is shown by default.
If you don't want the title to be shown in this case, unset the `showtitle` attribute using `showtitle!` in the document header or via the CLI or API.

When converted to an embeddable document, the document title is _not_ shown by default.
If you want the title to be shown, set the `showtitle` attribute in the document header or via the CLI or API.
The author and revision information is not shown below the document title in the embeddable version of the document like it is in the standalone document, even when the `showtitle` attribute is set.
