= Positional and Named Attributes

Let's break down the difference between positional and named attributes.

[#positional]
== Positional attribute

// tag::pos[]
Values placed in a specific order in an attribute list don't require an attribute name.
The attribute that the value is assigned to depends on the type of the element:

* `icon:` (1) size
* `image:` and `image::` (1) alt text, (2) width, (3) height
* Delimited blocks: (1) block name (aka style)
* Other inline quoted text: (1) role

For example, the following two image macros are equivalent.

[source]
----
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,300,400]

image::sunset.jpg[alt=Sunset,width=300,height=400]
----

The second macro is just a duplicate of the first macro written out longhand.
// end::pos[]

[#named]
== Named attribute

// tag::name[]
A named attribute consists of a name and a value separated by an `=` character (e.g., `name=value`).

If the value contains a space, comma, or quote character, it must be enclosed in double or single quotes (e.g., `name="value with space"`).
In all other cases, the surrounding quotes are optional.
If present, the enclosing quotes are dropped from the parsed value.

If the value contains the same quote character used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `value="the song \"Dark Horse\""`).

[#unset]
=== Unset a named attribute

To undefine a named attribute, set the value to `None` (case sensitive).
// end::name[]

== Substitutions

// tag::subs[]
Attribute references are expanded before the block attribute list is processed.
Therefore, it's not necessary to force substitutions to be applied if you simply want to use a document attribute reference in a block attribute.

If the attribute name (for a positional attribute) or value (for a named attribute) is enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `+title='Processed by https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]'+`), normal substitutions are applied to the value at assignment time (with some exceptions).
This is also true for positional attributes, such as the attribution for a quote block.
No special processing is performed, except for attribute reference expansion, if the value is not enclosed in quotes or is enclosed in double quotes.

If the attribute value contains the same quote character being used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `title="\"Dark Horse\" is a song by George Harrison"`).
// end::subs[]
