= Set and Unset a Boolean Attribute
// [#boolean-attribute]

A boolean attribute is a built-in attribute that acts like a toggle.
Its sole function is to turn on a feature or behavior.

== Constructing an attribute entry for a boolean attribute

A boolean attribute is set with an attribute entry in the header or body of a document.
Its value is always left blank because boolean attributes only accept an _empty string_ value, which Asciidoctor automatically assigns at processing time.

----
:name-of-a-boolean-attribute: <1>
----
<1> On a new line, type a colon (`:`), directly followed by the attribute's name and then another colon (`:`).
After the closing colon, press kbd:[Enter].
The attribute is now set and its behavior will be applied to the document.

== Setting a boolean attribute

Let's use an attribute entry to turn on the built-in boolean attribute named `sectanchors`.
When `sectanchors` is set, it xref:sections:title-links.adoc#anchor[activates an anchor in front of a section title] when a cursor hovers over it.

[source]
----
= Document Title
:sectanchors: <1>
----
<1> The value of `sectanchors` is always left empty because it's a boolean attribute.

== Unsetting a boolean attribute

Boolean document attributes can be unset by adding a bang symbol (`!`) directly in front of or after the attribute's name in an attribute entry.
The attribute entry must be on its own line.

----
:!name-of-a-boolean-attribute:
----

Let's use an attribute entry to turn off the built-in boolean attribute named `sectids`.
Asciidoctor automatically sets `sectids` at processing time unless you unset it.
The `sectids` attribute xref:sections:ids.adoc[generates an ID for each section] from the section's title.

[source]
----
= Document Title
:!sectids: <1>
----
<1> On a new line, type a colon (`:`), directly followed by a bang symbol (`!`), the attribute's name, and then another colon (`:`).
After the closing colon, press kbd:[Enter].
The attribute is now unset and its behavior won't be applied to the document.

Once an attribute is unset, its behavior is deactivated.
When `sectids` is unset, Asciidoctor will not generate IDs from section titles at processing time.
