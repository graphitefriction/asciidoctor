= Reference Built-in Attributes
//:xrefstyle: short
//:listing-caption: Example

You'll likely use the values of certain built-in attributes in specific locations throughout a document.
To reference and use the value of a document attribute, you enclose the attribute's name in curly brackets (`+{name-of-an-attribute}+`).
This inline element is called an *attribute reference*.

== Reference an explicitly set and defined built-in document attribute

TBA

== Reference an automatically set and defined built-in document attribute

An automatically set document attribute is referenced the same way as an explicitly set document attribute.
For instance, Asciidoctor automatically sets all of the character replacement attributes.
That means that you can reference them throughout your document without having to create an attribute entry in its header.

<1> Reference the character replacement attribute `deg` by enclosing its name in a set of curly brackets (`+{ }+`).

As you can see below, the attribute reference is replaced with the attribute's value when the document is processed.
