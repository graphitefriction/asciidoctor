= Attribute Lists

Attribute lists:

. apply to blocks, macros, and inline elements
. can contain positional and named attributes
. take precedence over document attributes (attribute entries)

.Anatomy of an attribute list
 [positional attribute,positional attribute,named attribute="value"]

Let's break down the difference between positional and named attributes.

[#positional]
== Positional attribute
// tag::pos[]
Values placed in a specific order in an attribute list don't require an attribute name.
The attribute that the value is assigned to depends on the type of the element:

* `icon:` (1) size
* `image:` and `image::` (1) alt text, (2) width, (3) height
* Delimited blocks: (1) block name (aka style)
* Other inline quoted text: (1) role

For example, `+image:sunset.jpg[Sunset,300,400]+` is equivalent to `+image:sunset.jpg[alt=Sunset, width=300, height=400]+`.
// end::pos[]

[#named]
== Named attribute
// tag::name[]
A named attribute consists of a name and a value separated by an `=` character.

If the value contains a space, comma, or quote character, it must be enclosed in double or single quotes.
In all other cases, the surrounding quotes are optional.
If present, the enclosing quotes are dropped from the parsed value.

If the value is enclosed in single quotes, in most cases, xref:subs:substitutions.adoc#substitution-groups[normal substitutions] are applied to the value at assignment time.
No special processing is performed if the value is not enclosed in quotes or is enclosed in double quotes.

If the value contains the same quote character used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `value="the song \"Dark Horse\""`).

[#unset]
=== Unset a named attribute

To undefine a named attribute, set the value to `None` (case sensitive).
// end::name[]
