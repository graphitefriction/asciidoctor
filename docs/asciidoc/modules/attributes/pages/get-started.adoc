= Getting Started with Attributes

Attributes set AsciiDoc apart from other lightweight markup languages.
Attributes activate behaviors, styles, and integrations, or hold replacement (variable) content.
There are three types of attributes: document, element, and environment.

Document attributes:: xref:document.adoc[Document attributes] apply built-in behavior and settings to a whole document, or in select cases, to regions of a document.
They make user-defined information available for use throughout a whole document.
They're set and defined in a document's header using an attribute entry, but can also be used from the API or command line.

Element attributes:: xref:element.adoc[Element attributes] apply built-in and user-defined styles, metadata, and behavior to individual block and inline elements in a document.
They're set and defined directly on the element they're modifying using an attribute list.
Element attributes are classified as positional or named.

Environment attributes:: Environment attributes provide information about the runtime environment, such as how, where, and when a document is being processed.
Environment attributes are built-in and Asciidoctor automatically sets and assigns them values when a document is loaded or converted.
Environment attributes can be referenced wherever attribute references are permitted, but it's recommended that you treat these attributes as read only.
