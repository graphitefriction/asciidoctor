= Getting Started with Block Attributes

Attributes are assigned to individual block and inline elements in a document using an attribute list.

== Block and inline elements

There are two kinds of elements in AsciiDoc, block and inline.

In an AsciiDoc document, one or more continuous lines of text is defined as a block element.
Examples of block elements are tables, callout lists, block macros such as `image::[]`, verse block titles, paragraphs, an attribute entry in the header, and the header as a whole.
Block elements can be nested within block elements.

An inline element performs an operation on a subset of the content within a block element.
Inline elements examples include inline macros, attribute references, and text marked up by inline formatting (italic, bold, etc.).

Attributes are assigned to block and inline elements using an [.term]*attribute list*.
