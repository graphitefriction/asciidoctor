= Activate the Table of Contents
// um anchor: user-toc

A table of contents (TOC) is an index of section titles that Asciidoctor automatically generates from the document's structure.

== Set the `toc` attribute

To enable the autogenerated TOC, you must set the `toc` attribute.
The `toc` attribute can be specified in the document header (`:toc:`) or via the command line (`-a toc`).

.TOC enabled via the document header
[source]
----
include::example$toc.adoc[]
----

.TOC enabled via the CLI
 $ asciidoctor -a toc adventure.adoc

When no other options are specified, the TOC is inserted directly below the document header (document title, author, and revision lines), is titled _Table of Contents_, and contains section 1 and section 2 level titles only.

You can customize the xref:title.adoc[Table of Contents title], the xref:section-depth.adoc[depth of the section levels], and the xref:position.adoc[position of the TOC in the document].
However, not all of the attributes are supported by all converters.
See the xref:toc-ref.adoc[TOC reference table] for which attributes are available to each converter.
