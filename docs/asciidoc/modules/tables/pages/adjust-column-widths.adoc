= Adjust Column Widths

== Column width

The width of a column is described by its column specifier.
Its value is an integer or a percentage that represents the width of the column in proportion to the other columns in the table.
The default width integer is `1`.
//re(the default is 1) or a percentage (1 to 99).
//proportional integer (the default is 1) or a percentage (1 to 99).

.Result: Table rendered with column sizes adjusted by a proportional integer
[cols="1,2,6"]

When assigning percentage values to the cols attribute, you do not need to include the percent sign (`%`).

[cols="50,20,30"]

.Result: Table rendered with column sizes adjusted by a percentage
[cols="50,20,30"]

Let's create a table with custom widths and alignments.

[source]
----
[cols=".<2,.^5,^.>3"]
include::example$column.adoc[tag=base-xtr]
----

.Result: Rendered table with variable widths and alignments
[cols=".<2,.^5,^.>3"]
include::example$column.adoc[tag=base-xtr]
