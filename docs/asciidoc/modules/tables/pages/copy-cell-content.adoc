= Copy Cell Content

== Cell formatting

In addition to sharing many of the column specifier capabilities, cell specifiers allow cells to span rows and columns.
Like a column specifier, a cell specifier is made up of components.
These components, listed and defined below, are all optional.

* span
* align
* style

A cell specifier is prefixed directly to the cell delimiter (`|`) preceding the content you want to customize.

The span component can duplicate a cell or have it span multiple rows or columns.

== Duplicate cell content

To duplicate a cell in multiple, consecutive columns, prefix the `|` with the multiplication factor and the `+*+` operator.
