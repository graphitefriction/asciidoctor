= Key Concepts

== Document

A document represents the top-level block element in AsciiDoc.
It consists of an optional document header and either a) one or more sections preceded by an optional preamble or b) a sequence of top-level blocks only.

The document can be configured using a document header.
The header is not a block itself, but contributes metadata to the document, such as the document title and document attributes.

== Elements

An element is an identifiable, addressable, and composible chunk of content in a document.
An AsciiDoc document is merely a composition of all the elements it contains.

Elements are a hierarchy of types, where one element may be a specialization of a family of elements.
For example, a sidebar block is a block element, so it shares the traits of all block elements, and also adds some of its own.
Elements include the document, sections, blocks, block macros, and inline phrases and macros.

== Attributes

Attributes are the name given to metadata in AsciiDoc.
An attribute is a name/value pair.
Though, for elements, the name can be an index.

An attribute is an abstract term.
There are two concrete classifications for attributes: document attributes and element attributes.

Document attributes, as the name implies, are associated directly with the document.
These attributes are used to export information about the document and runtime, control behavior of the processor, and to store reusable values or phrases.
Document attributes can be referenced in the content using an attribute reference (whereever the attribute substitution is enabled).
A Document attribute can be defined in the document using an attribute entry or from the API or CLI.

Element attributes are metadata on a specific element, like a block or an inline element, and only apply to that element.
Element attributes are not accessible at all from the content, so they cannot be referenced like document attributes.
Element attributes enrich or configure the behavior of an element, such as to apply a role or set the width of an image.
An element attribute is defined using an attribute list on an element, or an avaiable shorthand like a block title line.

== Macros

A macro is a syntax for representing non-text elements or that expands into text using the provided metadata.

Here's an example of a block macro:

[source]
----

----

Here's an example of an inline macro:

[source]
----

You can think of a macro like a function.
A syntax of macro follows the form of a name, a target which is sometimes optional, and an attribute list consisting of zero or more element attributes enclosed in square brackets.
There are two variations of a macro: block and inline.
In a block macro, the name and target are separated by two colons (`::`) and it must reside on a line by itself.
In an inline macro, the name and target are separated by a single colon (`:`) and it can be alongside text and other inline elements.
A block macro is always parsed, whereas an inline macro is only parsed where the macro substitution is enabled.

== Preprocessor Directives

There's another syntax in AsciiDoc that look a lot like block macros, only they aren't.
These are the preprocessor directives.

A preprocessor directive is function that controls lines that are fed into the parser.
A conditional preprocessor directive can configure lines to be included or excluded based on the presence of an attribute (ifdef, ifndef) or another arbitrary condition (ifeval).
An include directive can add additional lines to the document taken from another document.

Like a block macro, a preprocessor directive must be on a line by itself.
While the preprocessor directive can access document attributes, it is not otherwise aware of the context around it.
It's only a line processor.
