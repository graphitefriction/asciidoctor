A footnote is created with the footnote macro (`+footnote:[]+`).
If you plan to reference a footnote more than once, use the footnote macro with a target (`+footnote:id[]+`).

.Footnote syntax
[source]
----
include::example$footnote.adoc[tag=base-c]
----
<1> Insert the footnote macro directly after any punctuation. Note that the footnote macro only uses one colon (`:`).
<2> Insert the footnote's content within the square brackets (`+[]+`). The text may span several lines.
<3> If you plan to reuse a footnote, use `footnote:` and provide a unique ID in the target position.
<4> Enter the footnote text between the square brackets.
<5> The next time you reference the footnote, you only need to insert the ID in the target slot (leaving the text between the square brackets empty).

The footnotes will be numbered consecutively throughout the article.
