= Button UI Macro

IMPORTANT: You must set the `experimental` attribute to enable the UI macros.

== Button macro syntax

It can be equally difficult to communicate to the reader that they need to press a button.
They can't tell if you are saying "`OK`" or they are supposed to look for a button labeled *OK*.
It's all about getting the semantics right.
The `btn` macro to the rescue!
